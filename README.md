# Markov Decision Processes Applications

As part of my Reinforcement Learning course, I had the opportunity to model two real-world scenarios as Finite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs): safety in autonomous driving 🚗💨 and autonomous stock trading 📈💡.

I started with a brief introduction to MDPs, a fundamental concept in any RL algorithm 🤖, before designing each scenario from scratch. This involved identifying states, transition probabilities, and reward structures 🎯. I then applied value iteration and policy iteration algorithms to find the optimal policies, followed by an in-depth analysis of the results 📊.

If you're interested in MDPs or Reinforcement Learning, feel free to check out my report! I’d be happy to share more insights into these fascinating applications 📚✨.

I can’t wait to delve even deeper into these topics and learn how to further improve RL applications to tackle complex challenges 🚀🔍.
